# Master line list for spectral synthesis with Turbospectrum
## SAGA Team ##

The line list is described in Giribaldi & Smiljanic (2021, submitted to Experimental Astronomy as part of the CUBES Special Edition).


- 27.10.2020
    - This line-list version was created by Riano Giribaldi.
    - Data of the atomic species were retrieved from the VALD database Ryabchikova, T. et al. (2015, PhyS, 90, 4005). doi: 10.1088/0031-8949/90/5/054005
    - The Ge I line at 3039.067 A was updated with the data from Peterson & Barbuy (2020, A&A, 638, A64)
    - First version uploaded to Gitlab on this date by R. Smiljanic.

    - Rodolfo Smiljanic added HFS to the Be II doublet lines at 3130 and 3131 A.
    - Absolute transition frequencies are from Nortershauser et al. (2015, Phys. Rev. Lett., 115, 033002).
    - Transition probabilities from Yan et al. (1998, Phys. Rev. A, 57, 1652).
    - Broadening by collisions from hydrogen atoms computed by Barklem & O'Mara (2000, MNRAS, 311, 535).
    - Magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole HFS constants from Yerokhim (2008, Phys. Rev. A, 78, 012513). 
    - 6-j symbols are calculated with the Python code of Mathar (2011, https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5125v3).
